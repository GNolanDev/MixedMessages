# Mixed Messages - Euro Balls

## Aim

A project set by Codecademy as part of the full stack path. On clicking a button, a text string should be displayed with a random match-up between Euro 2020(21!) teams, followed by a random commentator comment and a random manager comment. Enjoy the exquisite nonsense!

## Technologies

- ECMAScript 6
- HTML5
- CSS3

## Requirements

Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://gnolandev.github.io/MixedMessages/), but will run on any modern browser by downloading all files to the same directory and opening _index.html_.

## Contact

Created by GNolanDev@gmail.com - comments gratefully received!
